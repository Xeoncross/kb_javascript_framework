## kB JavaScript Framework

This is a tiny JavaScript framework that includes everything needed by most sites to do basic effects and AJAX requests. Very few sites actually use everything that a full massive framework like jQuery or Mootools offers. Most simply need some of the following features:

 * Sending AJAX GET/POST requests
 * Inserting DOM elements
 * Encoding/Decoding JSON
 * Animating Elements (FX)
 * * Moving elements
 * * Fading in/out elements
 * * Sliding in/out elements
 * Serializing Form Data
 * Creating Modals
 * Image Lightboxes
 * Scrolling the browser window
 * Adding functions to DOM ready
 * Adding functions to element events (onClick/Submit/Hover etc..)

If your site is heavily based on JavaScript I would not advise you to use KB. This framework is only to provide some of the most commonly used functions for 95% of all sites in a simple and easy-to-use way without wasting bandwidth on feature-creep.

This framework can be used with other frameworks as long as the $() function is removed (first line of kB.js).
